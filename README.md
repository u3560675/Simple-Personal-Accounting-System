In order to get a feel of the program, copying the files found in the "sample_records" folder and pasting them into the "data" folder is recommended. This will mean that the program will have existing sample records that you can feel free to experiment with. 

When you want to genuinely begin using the program, do not forget to delete these sample files and start fresh.

### Creating Accounts
First things first, you have to create a couple of accounts (two are needed to make a transaction).

Note that if you have decided to use the sample files, you should begin by listing the accounts first to see which account codes have already been used and what kind of accounts have already been made.

Press 2 in the main menu to reach this screen:

This option as well as the others comes with its own add, change, delete and search functions.

Add New Account Code:

The alert is issued immediately after a transaction is made that results in the budget limit being crossed.

### Experimenting
You may now try adding, changing and deleting some new or existing account codes, transactions and budget records. Afterwards, try searching for or listing them to see what you've done.

### Viewing Statistical Reports
The program also creates certain statistical reports that are updated every time a transaction is made.
